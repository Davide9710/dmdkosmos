# JJE Bank

## About
JJE Bank is a banking system between different databases.
- Assume a scenario where Bank M, which uses MySQL, and Bank P, which uses PostgreSQL, merge.
- Both databases are used without modification.
- However, it behaves as a single system.

## How to run
I highly recommend to run on [intelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/ja-jp/idea/).

First of all, you need to reload project on **pom.xml**.

Then, you can accses on http://localhost:8080/ if you run **Main.java**.
